# Event Manager

## Description

This project involves organizing a political activism event. A number of people have registered for the event and I am tasked with engaging these future attendees. The first task involves finding the government representatives of each registered individual based on their zipcode. The second task was writing thank you letters using an erb template. I then found the best times and days of the week to run ads based on registration numbers in order to increase attendance for next years event.

## What I Learned

This project is written in the Ruby programming language and is part of the Odin Project Curriculum. I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Writing scripts to process data
- Using external APIs
- File I/O
- Utilizing regular expressions
- Using the erb template language
